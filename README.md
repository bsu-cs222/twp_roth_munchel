CS 230 Two Week Project

Authors: Cole Munchel and Brody Roth

This project was trying to take data from a wikipedia title and output the final editor and the time stamp that they did it. They wanted us to have the system tell you if there is a network problem. They also wanted us to give the last 4 users and output names and dates and wanted us to try 30 as well. This project was completed by Cole Munchel and Brody Roth.
